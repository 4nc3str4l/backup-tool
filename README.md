# backup-tool (Yeah the name sucks)
My tinny tool used to backup files periodically in some platforms encrypting files there if desired.


## Instructions

It is important that you provide a config file that looks like the one at [here](https://github.com/4nc3str4l/backup-tool/blob/main/config.example.json) with the name config.json or you need to run the program as:

```
backup-tool.exe --config="<path_to_your_own_config>"
```
